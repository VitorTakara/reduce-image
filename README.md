# reduce-image 🖼

A reducer image size using Gulp.
Just a simple project to help me 🙌

# How to use 😎

<ol>
  
  <li>Clone the project</li>
  <li>Insert your images inside `app/input` folder.
  <li>Run `npm install`</li>
  <li>Run `gulp` **OR** inside `app` folder, there is a batch file. Just run it.</li>
  <li>See your compressed images inside `app/output` folder 😊
  
</ol>

You can also create a shortcut of `app/START.bat` on your desktop, so you can run it easier 😉
