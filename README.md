# reduce-image 🖼

A reducer image size using Gulp.
Just a simple project to help me 🙌

# How to use 😎
  
1) Clone the project
2) Insert your images inside `app/input` folder.
3) Run `npm install`
4) Run `npm run start` **OR** inside `app` folder, there is a batch file. Just run it.
5) See your compressed images inside `app/output` folder 😊

You can also create a shortcut of `app/START.bat` on your desktop, so you can run it easier 😉
